Tasks for Project 9 and Team [4]
=====================================

Proposal

Part A
---------

	- task 1: Make point labels only viewable when mouse hovers over the point. This will be done by altering class 
          GraphView. We will have to implement mouseListener, then write a method to get the desired action 
          when the mouse hovers over a point. We will add a label to the graph to let the user know to hover over
          a point to get specific data info.
	- [Zach Rooney will be responsible for this]
	-  DUE : 12/8/2016
	- [ACTUAL COMPLETION DATE TO github.com repo: 12/6/16]


	- task 2: Make a search function. This will be a new class (name TBD) that extends JPanel (Or JButton). The search button will
	  be added to the main frame. When clicked it will have a pop up window that allows the user to search for subscription
	  data for a specific country and for a specific range of years. This will use class Country's getNumSubscriptionsForPeriod
	  method and will also implement MouseListener. The user will know about this feature because the search option will be 
	  displayed on the frame. 
	- [Tim Hsu will be responsible for this]

How It Actually Happened

	- Zach was able to implement mouse listener in graph view and hide all the data points until clicked (changed 
	  from hover). Originally, it was implemented with a drawString in the paintComponent() but once clicked the
	  labels couldn't be removed (easily). Upon meeting on Tuesday, Tim was able to help converting data points into
	  labels which made the removal easier and only allowed one datapoint to  show at a time. Also, in the Tuesday 
	  meeting a bug was detected with the graph ticks being off, Zach was able to fix so it aligned directly with the 
	  points. Tim was able to change the layout structure to add the new bottom panel. Tuesday night Tim was able to 
	  write the code to display the pop up window without actual data.
	 	 Wednesday we meet again. Zach was able to get the data needed for the pop up window by writing getCountry() in
	  LinkedList Class and then correctly formating data. Tim was then able to use the data and add it to the pop up 
	  window search function. Zach also did some minor formating (changing graph labels and positioning) and 
	  Tim some error handling to prevent doubles of countries. Wednesday night Tim finished some error handling by 
	  fixing the horizontal scroll panel on Legend Class. He also "cleaned" our code but removing old and extra code.
	  We are still having some issue with github. Most of the time it works, sometimes it is required to remove project
	  and re clone. We would verbally say when we did a commit or text.
	  
Extra Credit

	-	 There were several discussions on format and appearance. We decided to keep title in one line instead of two,
	  having a beginning (default) label next to get subscriptions button, whether to use mouse click or hover,
	  and how big to make the borders are some examples. We also had several discussions on how to add JLabels. 
	  In particular, how to use the MouseLisenter. We originally tried to add the JLabel in the MousListner click 
	  method. We found that this didn't work so we had it make changes in the MouseLisenter and add the JLabel in the
	  paintComponent. Lastly, there were several discussions on layout and which layout method to use.
