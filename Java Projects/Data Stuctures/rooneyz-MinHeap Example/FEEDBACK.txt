FEEDBACK:

Well done!


Good use of expressions when splitting the input in your CSVReader class.


-0 Why are the attributes of CSVReader such as "countryNames" and "yearLabels" package visible (i.e protected)?
   You have getter methods for them so they can be accessed from outside.
   Unless you can justify, all attributes must be private.
	int[] yearLabels;
   Next time minus one for each class.
   
   
-0 For future, place README.txt at top-level directory under project folder. 
   See feedback from previous project.
 	Next time minus one for this.

-Bita.
